Oswald is a reworking of the classic gothic typeface style historically represented by designs such as 'Alternate Gothic'. The characters of Oswald have been re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

Oswald is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.
